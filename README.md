## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this component, I practiced:

- Structuring a small component semantically with HTML
- Centering content using Flexbox on both axes
- Creating hover effects using transitions
- Using CSS variables for cleaner and more maintainable styles

Here's a small snippet I'm proud of:

```css
.list-item:hover {
  background-color: var(--color-green);
  cursor: pointer;
}

.list-item:hover .link {
  color: var(--color-grey-dark);
}
```

This adds interactivity to the buttons while preserving good contrast and accessibility.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- CSS logical properties to improve support for different writing directions

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Inter)
